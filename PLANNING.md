Planning voor A2 (Deadline: 30 oktober)

Taken:

1. Multinomial naive Bayes (generative linear classifier),
2. Regularized logistic regression (discriminative linear classifier),
3. Classification trees, (flexible classifier) and
4. Random forests (flexible classifier).


640 reviews for training & hyper-parameter tuning.
160 reviews for testing.


Performance measures: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.


Volgende vragen in het verslag beantwoorden:
1. How does the performance of the generative linear model (multinomial
naive Bayes) compare to the discriminative linear model (regularized
logistic regression)?
2. Is the random forest able to improve on the performance of the linear
classifiers?
3. Does performance improve by adding bigram features, instead of using
just unigrams?
4. What are the five most important terms (features) pointing towards a
fake review?
5. What are the five most important terms (features) pointing towards a
genuine review?
